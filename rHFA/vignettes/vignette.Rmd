# Introduction

## Home Field Advantage in Plant Breeding

Background of the HFA stat and why it's important.

### How Home Field Advantage is Calculated

HFA equation and a description. Could add some example data/code?

# Guide

## Step 1: Load dataset

Data must be in long format containing the plant variety and data from each location. See the yield_data.csv example file. 


## Step 2: ID home site

```{r eval=FALSE}
id_home(df = data_yield, year = "YEAR", geno = "LINE", pheno = "YIELD")
```


## Step 3: Get home site

```{r}
get_home_site(df = data_yield, geno = "LINE", site = "LOCATION")
```


## Step 4: Get Libraries



## Step 5: Filter site-years

## Step 6: Get SS

## Step 7: Permute HFA

## Step 8: Temporal HFA
